## Project Summary
Designed an asynchronous web scraping pipeline with Playwright, asyncio, and Pandas to extract web data from IMDb's Top 250 TV series. The pipeline automated navigation of JavaScript-rendered pages, normalized show URLs with regex, and applied resilient error handling for failed requestsâ€”achieving reliable data extraction. This initiative produced a clean CSV dataset ready for analytics, visualization, or integration into media recommendation systems.

## The workflow:
- Asynchronous orchestration with asyncio to scale requests and minimize runtime.
- Dynamic rendering handling via Playwright to reliably scrape JavaScript-heavy pages.
- Normalized extracted show links using regex for consistency and deduplication.
- Error resilience with retry logic to handle failed page loads gracefully.
- Data structuring with Pandas, exporting results into a clean, analysis-ready CSV.

## Tools Used
    Python, Playwright, Asyncio, Pandas
